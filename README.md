# Zoom City Carbon Model::High spatio-temporal resolution of Urban-Heat-Islands

## Introduction

We introduce the **Zoom City Carbon Model (ZCCM)**, an R-based tool for calculating net of CO2 fluxes from urban areas at high spatial and temporal resolutions. ZCCM incorporates major sources and sinks of carbon in cities, such as road traffic, buildings, human breathing, and vegetation and soils. This document presents **ZCCM::UHI**, which provides hourly estimates of air temperature whole-city level using local data. The **ZCCM::UHI** is divided into three files: **UHImodel**, and **UHI Geographic Information platform.** The *UHImodel* generates timeseries (.csv) and maps (.multipolylines) of traffic estimates and CO2 emissions, while the [UHI Geographic Information Platform](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/CO2-traffic-emissions/) communicates the outcomes of the ZCCM to users, stakeholders, research community, and public in general. This platform displays the outcomes of ZCCM in an interactive way through zoom CO2 maps and summary statistics of emissions, e.g., dashboard available on this [link](https://bymaxanjos.github.io/CO2-traffic-emissions/).

The **ZCCM::UHImodel** is still undergoing peer-review and should used with caution. 
Methodology is based on Anjos, M.; Meier, F. City Carbon Budget and hourly net CO2 fluxes at 0.01º resolution for informed climate action(in preparation).

### People

The development of the ZCCM::UHI was led by [Dr. Max Anjos](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Max-Anjos/research) and joined by Dr.Fred Meier, and it is hosted at the [Chair of Climatology, Institute of Ecology, Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.klima.tu-berlin.de/index.php?show=home_start&lan=en).

### Funding

This project is was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) – Finance Code 001, and by the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation.

### Contact

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions by emailing [maxanjos\@campus.ul.pt](mailto:maxanjos@campus.ul.pt). If you are interested in contributing to the development of the model, we welcome you to join our team.

Happy coding!
